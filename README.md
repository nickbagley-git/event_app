Users and Events is based off off of the object creation examples from the photo_blog lecture by Nat Tuck. I based the User and Event object off of his User andPost object.

The code for the setup of the html files is also based off of the photo_blog example from lecture. The controllers, router, and session portions are all based off of Nat Tuck's code in photo_blog as well.

The deployment code is also based off of lecture deployments.
